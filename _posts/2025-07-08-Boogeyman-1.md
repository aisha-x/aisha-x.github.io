# [Introduction] New threat in town.
Uncover the secrets of the new emerging threat, **the Boogeyman**.

You are tasked to analyse the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) executed by a threat group, from obtaining initial access until achieving its objective. 


## Artefacts

For the investigation proper, you will be provided with the following artefacts:

- Copy of the phishing email (`dump.eml`)
- Powershell Logs from Julianne's workstation (`powershell.json`)
- Packet capture from the same workstation (`capture.pcapng`)
> Note: The `powershell.json` file contains JSON-formatted PowerShell logs extracted from its original evtx file via the **evtx2json** tool.

## Tools

The provided VM contains the following tools at your disposal:

- **Thunderbird**- a free and open-source cross-platform email client.
- **LNKParse3**- a python package for forensics of a binary file with LNK extension.
- **Wireshark**- GUI-based packet analyser.
- **Tshark**- CLI-based Wireshark. 
- **jq**- a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

# [Email Analysis] Look at that headers!

Analyze and assess the impact of the compromise.

## Analysis Steps:

- Cat the content of the `dump.eml`.
- I paste the content in the [Message Header Analyzer](https://mha.azurewebsites.net/).
- The email was sent from `agriffin@bpakcaging.xyz` to `julianne.westcott@hotmail.com`
- The attacker used a third-party service called **Elastic Email** for the unsubscribe option

Copy the attachment's base64 encoding, and paste it in a text file, then decode it and save it as a zip file, as in the email attachment 

![Screenshot 2025-06-11 204418](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e2c801-0a04-48e5-b737-d090e74b1448)

You can simply open the email and save the attachment. Extract the zip file. It will return one file named: **Invoice_20230103.lnk**

![Screenshot 2025-06-11 205358](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706c77cc-2666-4adb-8c61-a4baf3055034)

A file with the `.lnk` extension, also known as a **Windows Shortcut File** or **LNK** file, is a pointer or link to another file, application, or folder on the system. we will use **LNK Parser**, which allows you to view the content of Windows shortcuts (`.LNK`) files.

![Screenshot 2025-06-11 213438](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae079500-d82a-4056-95fb-e5773357d1bb)

The target executable is `powershell.exe`, in **the command line argument**, it runs a base64 encoded script in a stealthy manner. In the **Icon** the the attacker make a shortcut look like an Excel file by using an Excel-style icon. But the actual action is downloading and running:

# [Endpoint Security] Are you sure that’s an invoice?

Based on the initial findings, we discovered how the malicious attachment compromised Julianne's workstation:

- A PowerShell command was executed.
- Decoding the payload reveals the starting point of endpoint activities. 

## Analysis Steps:

using the `jq` tool to convert JSON format and output the filter to standard output, as a sequence of newline-separated JSON data.

![Screenshot 2025-06-11 215419](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1514ccd6-671f-43fb-910e-9bde4259b98e)
![Screenshot 2025-06-11 215400](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f66b77-9590-464d-8f1a-d6ccb2665468)

Now it looks more readable. I used this command to cat the content, grep the fields that contain the malicious domain used in the email attachment, and the fields before `ScriptBlockText`. 
```bash
cat parsed.txt | grep -B 11 -n "bpakcaging.xyz"
```
![Screenshot 2025-06-11 222428](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11356aff-0d18-4c94-991d-bdd3d8787cc3)

at **2023-01-13 17:10:07**, the execution of the payload happened, after that it runs a malicious PowerShell reverse command-and-control (C2) script, designed to communicate with a remote server (`cdn[.]bpakcaging[.]xyz`) and execute commands it receives. It also downloaded two binaries (sb.exe, sq3.exe) from this domain (`files[.]bpakcaging[.]xyz`)

I used this command to match typical domain names
```bash
cat parsed.txt | grep -oE '\b([a-z0-9-]+\.)+[a-z]{2,6}\b'
```
![Screenshot 2025-06-11 231058](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d867c8c-1236-4596-8d4d-fc48fa6de673)

There was a `github.com` domain name, which is unusual; filter the log for this domain.

![Screenshot 2025-06-11 231416](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb1589bd-7310-44ab-84d4-d207b3df0845)

The attacker downloaded a tool called a seatbelt from this [repository](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack), which is a PowerShell version of a C# project that performs a number of security-oriented host-survey "safety checks" relevant from both offensive and defensive security perspectives -> [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt). After the attacker downloaded `sq3.exe` binary, he accessed `plum.sqlite` file. This is a SQLite database used by **Sticky Notes** to store the user's notes. 

![Screenshot 2025-06-11 234819](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/189efcbe-3c2d-4fad-a3cb-c217fb43454c)

Are there any exfiltrated files? We know the attacker is using two domains; find the IP address of these domains. I searched for the domain IP that's been used for file hosting. 

![Screenshot 2025-06-12 115545](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2cfc0e8-7e77-4c31-b5bb-f11e17b6b568)

at **2023-01-13 17:32:15.** The attacker attempted to read a **KeePass** file (`.kdbx`) from the victim's documents directory, preparing it as raw bytes for exfiltration and sending it to the remote host (the attacker's IP). **KeePass** is a popular open-source password manager. 
**How is the data exfiltrated?** I used this command 
```bash 
cat parsed.txt | grep -B 11 "bpakcaging.xyz"
```
![Screenshot 2025-06-12 122222](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18afc084-be42-45ed-a27b-669d8a2e9780)

from the above output, at **2023-01-13 17:32:41**, the attacker used `$hex`, which contains hex-encoded data, and split it into chunks of 50 non-whitespace characters — a typical size to stay under DNS label limits. For each 50 chunks, using the **nslookup** tool, it performs a **DNS A record query**. The domain looks like: `<data-chunk>.bpakcaging[.]xyz`. The queries are **sent to a remote DNS server** controlled by the attacker (`$destination`), which logs each DNS query, effectively receiving the data covertly.

# [Network Traffic Analysis] They got us. Call the bank immediately!
Based on the PowerShell logs investigation, we have seen the full impact of the attack:

- The threat actor was able to read and exfiltrate two potentially sensitive files.
- The domains and ports used for the network activity were discovered, including the tool used by the threat actor for exfiltration.


## Analysis Steps:

Based on the custom header the attacker crafted, filter the pcap file for http contains this header. In the Server header, it indicates the web server software responding to the request is **Python Built-in SimpleHTTPServer**

![Screenshot 2025-06-12 125041](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5b710ea-12b5-4551-84c5-be92b615c256)
![Screenshot 2025-06-12 125130](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88129903-7bad-4746-a66a-a52b73a38bba)

Based on the command from the PowerShell, the attacker used this URL `<C2 server>/27fe2489` with `POST` method to output the command executed by the attacker. Notice the user_agent is windowsPowershell which means a **PowerShell script** is making web requests, 

![Screenshot 2025-06-12 130606](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bf63b5c-6467-4e9a-916a-b45b9c22edd8)
![Screenshot 2025-06-12 130629](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7829fc4-2569-4ca3-b0be-3100ca8cc708)

The attacker exfiltrated a **sqlite** file, based on the timestamp of the exfiltrated file in the PowerShell log (happened at **2023-01-13 17:25:38**), filter the pcap file for **POST** method, and inspect packets close to the exfiltrated file. 

![Screenshot 2025-06-12 135700](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5b928f3-ee89-47b9-b932-6689ffcd047b)
![Screenshot 2025-06-12 135943](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a66717f-c9d0-4b51-872a-49f780ad6f64)


frame no: **44467** has a timestamp **2023 17:25:39**, which differs by one second, follow the stream, copy the decimal content of the packet, and use CyberChef to decode the decimal

![Screenshot 2025-06-12 140922](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05992ad4-6c61-4112-b105-838f6211276e)
![Screenshot 2025-06-12 140934](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b6103d-895b-4ba7-bbde-3006c561fa91)

Now we know that the attacker used a DNS query for the exfiltration, filter the pcap file related to the C2 server and DNS records. 

![Screenshot 2025-06-12 142657](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c520bc90-e090-40aa-941d-3acd60c78f84)

The sensitive file was exfiltrated in chunks `<data-chunk>.bpakcaging.xyz`, we need to combine all 444 data-chunk parts from the query to view the content. Now let's use Wireshark CLI version! **TShark** to manipulate the output.

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcapng -n -T fields -e dns.qry.name | grep "bpakcaging.xyz" | cut -f 1 -d "." | uniq > chunk-data.txt
```
![Screenshot 2025-06-12 144324](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a0bd868-08c4-4b83-937e-ff02b0ebef16)

After saving it as .txt, clean it up directly from the text file and save it. One last thing is to delete all newline characters, using `tr -d '\n'` command.

![Screenshot 2025-06-12 145030](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/098e1ff4-6ecb-464b-8a19-52d175c81998)

Now decode hexadecimal and save it as `.kdbx` extension. Using the password extracted from the packets, we were able to view the victim's password manager.
