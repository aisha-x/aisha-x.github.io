## Introduction

**Challenge Link:** [REloaded](https://tryhackme.com/room/reloaded)

This room is dedicated for the RE challenges, each challenge has unique concepts divided in each binaries.

## Level 0

This challenge is the most basic of RE.  It will teach about how to enumerate files and get juicy details.

```c
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/0$ wine Level-0_1610287551028.exe 
Enter The Flag :: test
Dont Worry its a start ;)
```

I searched for the string `Dont Worry its a start ;)` in the source code, and found this function

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv0-0.webp)

The function stores the expected key`"L3v3lZ340_is_D02e"` in `local_28`   then compare the user input (`param_1`) with the expected string via `FUN_004a3220`

Double-click on `FUN_004a3220` , it checks if the length of the two parameters is equal; if so, it will pass it to the function `FUN_0046f910` 

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv0-1.webp)

Navigating to the function `FUN_0046f910` we see it uses `memcmp()` function that is used to compare two blocks of memory byte by byte. Syntax

```c
int memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);
```

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv0-2.webp)

So eventually, our input is compared against `L3v3lZ340_is_D02e` 

```c
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/0$ wine Level-0_1610287551028.exe 
Enter The Flag :: L3v3lZ340_is_D02e
That was easy....Bruh!!!
```

## Level 1

Level 0 was piece of cake for you now I am keeping my cake in the cage.

```c
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/1$ wine Level-1_1610287698659.exe 
N00b a day, pro for life
```

Searched for the printed string from **Search > for string** to start the search from the function printed this text

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv1-1.webp)

The function checks for the user input, if there is no passed argument, then it will print `N00b a day, pro for life` else, it will call the function `FUN_0040141`

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv1-2.webp)

And here is the function that checks for the passed arguments; it checks if the value is equal to 0x6ad → 1709d 

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv1-3.webp)

```bash
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/1$ wine Level-1_1610287698659.exe 1709
Thats ur lucky number !!!
```

## Level 2

As a security analyst, you found some suspicious app in your organization which enables employees secretly share their file to the rival organization.  Your task is to find who is involved in this treachery, but the app needs some key to log in. Can you patch this app to bypass Authentication?

```bash
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/2$ wine Level-2_1610288072323.exe 
Wow Ur At L3?
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/2$ wine Level-2_1610288072323.exe  test
In order to advance you have to break your mindset
```

Navigating to the function that prints the output, we see that it uses the function `strncpy()` 

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv2.webp)

The `strncpy()` function in C is used to copy a specified number of characters from a source string to a destination string. Syntax

```c
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```

So in the code, it copied the string “L3_1s_20t_Th3_L131t” to `local_20` size of 14h, then it used `strcmp()` function to compare the string saved in `local_20` to our input. 

```c
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/2$ wine Level-2_1610288072323.exe L3_1s_20t_Th3_L131t
Get Ready For L4 ;)
L3_1s_20t_Th3_L131t
```

And the instruction we modified in the assembly code is `JNZ`(jump if not zero), if the string matches, it will print success; otherwise, it will jump to `LAB_00401470` and print `In order to advance you have to break your mindset`

## Level 3

Bob was fired due to his inappropriate behavior with colleagues. While leaving he deleted the code which decrypts the password stored in the code. As a reverse engineer it's your task to recover that master password since the code is in prod now and cant is modified but you have a copy of the app. everything depends on you now  !!!

```c
remnux@remnux:~/Downloads/REloaded/3$ wine Level-3_1610295976945.exe 
Enter the flag ::test
-_-
```

Here is the function that compares our string with the password

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv3-1.webp)

`FUN_004014af` builds a 24-byte buffer `local_40` by calling `FUN_00401410` to prepare some data in `local_28`, then copying 24 characters (indices `0`..`0x17`) from that prepared data into `local_40`. After that it compares the user-provided string `param_1` to `local_40` with `strcmp()` and prints `"Rooted !!!"` if they match, otherwise `"-_-"`. Finally it calls `FUN_00495290(local_28)` to clean up.

Here is the function that stores the password

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv3-2.webp)

The function stores each byte in `local_1f` then loops each byte and modifies it by XORing it with the number `7`at runtime.. [HexToStringConverter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html)

## Level 4

They are back!!! and using some sort of encryption algorithm to communicate. Although we intercepted their messages we cant decode them, Agent 35711 has successfully stolen their test encryption code. Now it's on you to build a decryptor for test messages and save this world.﻿

If you run the program, it will print a random string, so instead of searching for these strings, search for the function that printed that output, and in this source code, it is the `printf()` function

![Alt](/images/REloaded/lv4-1.webp)

The function loops through each character of the input string, if `FUN_00401410(i)` returns 0 → it XORs the character with `0x37`otherwise it XORs the character with its index `i` then it print the transformed string. The function has one cross-reference to `FUN_004014e6` at the address `00401532`. Double-clicking on it, and you will see that the function uses `strncpy()` function to copy the string “Alan …” into `local_2a`, then call the above funciton `FUN_00401453`on it
